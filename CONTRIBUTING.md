# Contributing to Awesome Agent Cortex

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This list is curated, so not every
submission will be accepted — but we welcome all suggestions.

## Adding an Entry

### Format

```markdown
- [Project Name](https://github.com/user/repo) - Concise description of what it does.
```

### Rules

1. **One entry per pull request.** Batch PRs are harder to review.
2. **Description** starts with a capital letter and ends with a period.
3. **No marketing language** — avoid superlatives like "best", "fastest", "revolutionary".
4. **No trailing slashes** on URLs.
5. **Drop unnecessary articles** (A, An, The) at the start of descriptions.
6. **Alphabetical order** within each section.
7. **Working links only** — dead links will be removed.
8. The project should be **actively maintained** (commit within the last 12 months).
9. The project should have **meaningful documentation** (at minimum a README).

### What We Look For

- Genuine usefulness to agent builders
- Active maintenance and community
- Clear documentation
- Unique value — not a thin wrapper around another listed project

## Awesome Score Rubric (5-point)

To keep reviews consistent, we score candidate entries from 1 (weak) to 5
(strong) across five dimensions:

1. **Maintenance**
   - Recency of commits/releases, issue responsiveness, non-archived status.
2. **Documentation quality**
   - Clear README/docs, setup steps, examples, and API usage guidance.
3. **Production readiness**
   - Stability signals (tests/CI, real users, operational guidance).
4. **Unique value**
   - Adds new capability/coverage vs existing list entries.
5. **Security posture**
   - Reasonable security controls/disclosures for its category.

### Suggested acceptance baseline

- Recommended: average score >= 3.5/5
- Strongly preferred: no individual dimension below 3

In PR descriptions, include a short rubric line, e.g.:

`Awesome Score: Maintenance 4, Docs 5, Production 4, Unique 4, Security 3`

### What We Reject

- Abandoned or archived projects
- Projects with no documentation
- Duplicate entries
- Self-promotion without substance
- Entries that do not fit any existing section

## Intentional Cross-Listings (Duplicate Entries)

Some resources are intentionally listed in multiple sections when they provide
strong value across distinct workflows (for example: Prompt + Evaluation, or
Coding Agent + CLI Tool).

Rules for cross-listing:

1. Only cross-list when the overlap is clearly meaningful to users.
2. Keep the description aligned to each section's context (same project, but
   section-relevant phrasing is okay).
3. In PRs, explicitly call out intentional cross-listings in the description so
   reviewers do not remove them as accidental duplicates.
4. Avoid excessive repetition. If a project appears in more than two sections,
   justify why.

## Catalog-Driven README Workflow

The curated resources block in `README.md` is generated from `data/resources.json`.

When changing entries:

1. Edit `data/resources.json`.
2. Regenerate README:
   - `python .github/scripts/generate_readme_from_catalog.py`
3. Commit both `data/resources.json` and `README.md`.

CI enforces that the generated README matches the catalog.

## Suggesting a New Section

Open an issue first to discuss whether a new section is warranted. New sections
should have at least 5 qualifying entries before being added.

## Reporting Issues

- **Broken link?** Open an issue or PR with the fix.
- **Outdated description?** Same — issue or PR.
- **Project no longer maintained?** Open an issue and we will review.
